<!--
This template generates the benches tables;

You can modify the disposition as you wish and the program will adapt, other correct table heads :

| Day | Part One | Part Two | Day | Part One | Part Two |
| --- | :------: | :------: | --- | :------: | :------: |

| Day | Part One | Part Two |
| --- | :------: | :------: |


To simplify the process, here's the configuration line :

BenchesColumns=1

-->

{{START}}
| Day | Part One | Part Two |
| --- | :------: | :------: |
{{END}}
